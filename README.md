# MamiCamp2020
Repository for MamiCamp 2020. There are 2 branches that I made for this project, the first is "master" 
branch which follows the original tutorial from raywenderlich and
"my-version" branch which is a variation that I made from the tutorial application.


in this branch I will add several features.
- every game ends, the final score will be stored in the cloud database database.
- There is new button to display game history page that is displayed from Firebase Cloud Firestore.
